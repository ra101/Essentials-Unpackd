rvpacker packs and unpacks binary RPG Maker project data to and from YAML so
that it can be version-controlled and collaborated on.

Usage:
        rvpacker {--pack|--unpack} [options]

Options:
EOS

  # NOTE: The `--action` option is deprecated and will likely be removed in the
  #   future.
  opt :action, 'Action to perform on the project (pack|unpack)', type: String
  opt :pack, 'Pack YAML into binary RPG Maker data'
  opt :unpack, 'Unpack binary RPG Maker data to YAML'
  opt :project, 'Absolute Path to Essentials Game Folder, Else current Folder will be Selected', short: 'd', type: String
  opt :force, 'Update target even when source is older than target'
  opt :verbose, 'Print verbose information while processing', short: 'V'
end

# Fail fast if any of the `pack`, `unpack`, or `action` options are combined.

# Attempt to parse which action to perform (packing YAML to binary data or
# unpacking binary data to YAML). Warn if the `action` option was used, as it
# is likely to be removed in the future and fail fast if the action is Unknown
# or missing entirely.
